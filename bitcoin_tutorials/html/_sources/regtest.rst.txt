===================================
Working with regtest mode bitcoin
===================================

::

	>bitcoind -regrest -daemon
	Bitcoin server starting

This creates a private blockchain

::

	>bitcoin-cli -regtest generate 101


Generate 101 blocks using a special RPC which is only available in regtest mode. This takes about 30 seconds on a generic PC. Because this is a new block chain using Bitcoinâ€™s default rules, the first blocks pay a block reward of 50 bitcoins. Unlike mainnet, in regtest mode only the first 150 blocks pay a reward of 50 bitcoins. However, a block must have 100 confirmations before that reward can be spent, so we generate 101 blocks to get access to the coinbase transaction from block #1

::

	>bitcoin-cli -regtest getbalance
	50.0000

Verify that we now have 50 bitcoin available

You can now use Bitcoin Core RPCs prefixed with bitcoin-cli -regtest.
